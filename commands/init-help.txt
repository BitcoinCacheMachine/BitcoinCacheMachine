eDescription:
  bcm init  Initialize your localhost to become an SDN controller (mgmt plane) for your BCM deployments.
            This tool installs docker via snap, and creates docker images needed at the SDN controller. 
            This command creates new GPG certificates, so have your Trezor handy.

Usage:
  bcm init --cert-name="Satoshi Nakamoto" --username="satoshi" --hostname="bitcoin.org"

Options:
  --cert-name   The name that will appear in the PGP certificate.
  --username    The username that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --hostname    The FQDN that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-dir    Directory where public key material will be emitted.
                The default directory is whatever GNUPGHOME is set to.
