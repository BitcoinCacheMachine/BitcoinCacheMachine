Description:
  Create and manage clusters (i.e., LXD cluster). A cluster is a collection of one or 
  more LXD endpoints all connected to a private networking environment that is low latency 
  and high bandwidth, such as a home or office LAN. BCM components (app containers like bitcoind) 
  are deployed to BCM-managed clusters.


Usage:
  bcm cluster [command]

Related Command:
  bcm config set cluster=<cluster_name> - changes your active cluster.

Available Commands:
  create        Creates a new cluster definition and attempts to bring
                all machines into basic operation.
  destroy       Destroys all LXD instances within a cluster. All data is 
                destroyed.
  list          List your clusters under management by your BCM client.

Use "bcm cluster [command]" to get help for that command.
