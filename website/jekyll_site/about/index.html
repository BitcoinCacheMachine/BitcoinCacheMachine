<p>Bitcoin Cache Machine is open-source software that allows you to create a self-hosted privacy-preserving
    software-defined data-center. BCM is built entirely with free and open-source software and is meant primarily for
    home and small office use in line with the spirit of decentralization.</p>

<p>BCM runs entirely inside open source Linux, so it's free. It's built entirely with open-source software. You can
    deploy BCM instances to one or more clusters located across the Internet. Achieve local high-availability by
    deploying BCM to three or more computers. BCM installs software across each failure domain to ensure high
    availability.</p>

<p>BCM is an event-driven system. When something happens, say a lightning invoice is paid, this event gets captured
    inside of a distributed Kafka cluster. You can deploy workflows against this event flow to create custom logic that
    meets your particular needs.</p>
