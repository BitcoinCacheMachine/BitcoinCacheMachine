# Contributing

## Getting Started

Sign up for a github.com account.

Fork the BitcoinCacheMachine repository to your account. Clone the repo to your machine, then make a development branch to do your work

    git checkout -b branch-name

BCM is developed in Visual Studio Code by BCM's main authors. Feel free to use any editor you want, just be sure to .gitignore any editor manifests.

## Linters

The authors of BCM ensures that BCM bash scripts are shellcheck compliant. Install shellcheck `sudo apt-get install shellcheck` then add any editor extensions you might want, such as Bash Beautify.

## Pull Requests

When you are done, rebase squash any multiple commits you have into one

    git rebase -i master

Run BCM's test suite (TODO):

    ./tests/tests.sh (TODO)

push your branch (-f for *force* in the case you've rebased and squashed)

    git push origin branch-name -f
    
create a [pull request](https://github.com/BitcoinCacheMachine/BitcoinCacheMachine/projects) into the BitcoinCacheMachine repo master branch.

If you have fixes, you can amend them to the current commit rather than a new one with

    git commit --amend
    git push -f

## Review Board

TODO - Define change control / pull request review process.
